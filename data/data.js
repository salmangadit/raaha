		"description":"This summary covers the first one and a quarter Juzu of the Qur'ân, beginning with Sûrah Fâtiha and concluding with verse 176 of Sûrah Baqara.",
		"content":"Start of First Juz \n\nSûrah Fâtiha is usually referred to as Al Hamd Sharîf. Although this Sûrah was not the first Sûrah of the Qur'ân to be revealed, it is the first to be written in Qur'ânic manuscripts and the first to be recited when commencing recitation (Tilâwah) of the Qur'ân.\n\nSûrah Fâtiha is a du'â [supplication] that Allâh has taught mankind. Therefore, when a person recites Sûrah Fâtiha, s/he is actually making a du'â to Allâh. The rest of the Qur'ân follows as a reply to this du'â. In this du'â a person pleads to Allâh to show him the straight path [Sirâtul Mustaqîm]. Thereafter, Allâh gives man the entire Qur'ân as the guidance he asked for and as a description of the Sirâtul Mustaqîm which he wants to tread.\n\nSûrah Baqara follows Sûrah Fâtiha, in which Allâh says that the Qur'ân is a guide for people who have Taqwa. Therefore, the Qur'ân may not benefit those who have no desire for guidance and direction. Such people will be deprived of its illumination and shall remain spiritually deaf, dumb and blind. In Sûrah Baqara, Allâh invokes man to believe in the unseen, to establish Salâh and to spend in Allâh's way from the provisions that He has granted. The details of Imân are described as belief in the Qur'ân, belief in all the previously revealed Divine Scriptures and conviction in the Âkhirâh.\n\nAllâh also warns people against hypocrisy, warns the Kuffâr about the punishment of Jahannam, while also conveying the glad tidings of Jannah to the Mu'minîn. It is in this part of Sûrah Baqara that Allâh speaks about the creation of Hadhrat Âdam Alayhis Salâm and his appointment as Allâh's viceroy on earth. The test between the knowledge of Hadhrat Âdam and the angels is mentioned, together with Allâh's command to the angels to prostrate before Hadhrat Âdam. While all the angels complied, Iblîs refused. As a result of his arrogance, he was cursed and expelled from Jannah. Thereafter, the accursed Iblîs, tricked Hadhrat Adam Alayhis Salâm and Hadhrat Hawa Radiallâhu anha into eating from the forbidden tree. Thereafter, they were sent to live on earth. They repented to Allâh and were forgiven.\n\nAllâh also speaks of the time when He summoned Hadhrat Mûsa Alayhis Salâm toMount Tûr to receive the Torah [Taurat]. In his absence, the Bani Isrâ'îl began to worship the calf. However, they were forgiven for this act when they repented. On a daily basis Allâh provided them with Mann and Salwa to eat from the heavens, and also provided water for them from twelve springs that gushed from a rock. Allâh describes how the Jews were ungrateful for Allâh's bounties and how they behaved rebelliously and insolently. This, together with their hypocritical conduct drew Allâh's punishment upon them.\n\nThereafter, Allâh speaks about Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm who was successful in every trial that Allâh put him through. As a reward for this, Allâh made him a guide of mankind. Allâh commanded him and his son Hadhrat Ismâ'îl Alayhis Salâm to construct the Ka'bah, which they duly did. Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm made du'â to Allâh to raise a Nabî from among his progeny who would be a guide for mankind. Allâh accepted this du'â by raising Hadhrat Muhammad Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam, as a Nabî to the universe, via whom guidance spread throughout the world.\n\nEnd of First Juz\n\nBeginning of Second Juz\n\nThe beginning of the second Juz discusses the change of Qiblah. Allâh commands the Muslims to face towards the Ka'bah instead of Baitul Muqaddas [Jerusalem] when performing Salâh. Consequently, Muslims will always be required to face towards the Ka'bah wherever they may be. Allâh also prohibits the eating of carrion (dead animals), blood, swine and all animals that have been sacrificed in the name of any being besides Allâh"

		"description":"This summary of the second Tarawîh begins at the second quarter of the second Juz and concludes midway into the third Juz (at verse 18 of Sûrah Âl Imrân).",
		"content":"To a very large extent, Sûrah Baqara discusses the complete message of Islâm, dealing with matters such as the rights of Allâh, the rights of man, the method of living and the principles of social interaction. It also outlines laws pertaining to Salâh, Zakâh and Haj.\n\nIn addition to this, charity, social welfare, mutual consultation, marriage, divorce, Iddah [waiting period after a woman is divorced or widowed], bequests, commerce and giving loans are also discussed. The Sûrah also presents many commands and prohibitions, devoting much attention to matters that are permissible and those that are not. These may be referred to as a complete code of life.\n\nThe details of Imân and the criteria of Imân are also discussed in this part of the Sûrah. Allâh emphasises that people should believe in Allâh, His Rasul it, the Day of Qiyâmah, the angels, all His other Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm and all the Divine Scriptures that were revealed to various Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm during their respective periods. Allâh also commands Muslims to spend generously on their parents, relatives, the poor, orphans, travellers and those slaves who wish to purchase their freedom.\n\nAllâh commands that a murderer be executed [Qisâs]. However, if the heirs of the murdered person choose to rather accept the blood money, it will have to be paid. Fasting is ordained in this Sûrah, but people who are unable to fast have been granted certain concessions. Allâh makes it clear that marriage of Muslims to Mushrikîn men and women is prohibited. In addition to this, the Sûrah makes it clear that children are allowed to be suckled for a maximum period of two years.\n\nEnd of Second Juz\n\nBeginning of Third Juz\n\nAllâh declares all interest-related transactions to be undeniably Harâm towards the end of Sûrah Baqara. The Sûrah also relates the incidents of two Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm whose hearts Allâh put at ease when He demonstrated to them how He resurrects the dead. Throughout Sûrah Baqara, Allâh repeatedly emphasises the importance of pondering over the verses of the Qur'ân. At the very end of the Sûrah, Allâh teaches man the method of making du'â as well as the words to be used.\n\nThe first eighteen verses of Sûrah Âl Imrân make it clear that only Allâh is worthy of worship, that the Day of Qiyâmah will certainly dawn and that the people will definitely be rewarded and punished for their actions. Allâh tells mankind that the Qur'ân was revealed to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Allâh also speaks of the Battle of Badr in this Sûrah. If the Mu'minîn were to ponder about the stunning victory that the Muslims earned in this battle, they can learn volumes about Allâh's power. The true Mu'minîn are defined as people who persevere through hardships, who spend their wealth in Allâh's way and awaken during the latter part of the night to beg pardon from Allâh."

		"description":"This summary of the third Tarawîh commences at verse 18 of Sûrah Âl Imran and concludes at the end of Sûrah Âl Imrân.",
		"content":"Allâh speaks of Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm and his mother Hadhrat Maryam Radiallâhu anha. When she was placed in the care of Hadhrat Zakariyya Alayhis Salâm he noticed that she used to eat fruits that were not in season.\n\nUpon enquiry, she told him that it was from Allâh who sustains whomsoever He wills without any restrictions. This Sûrah mentions the miraculous birth of Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm from Hadhrat Maryam Radiallâhu anha without a father. As an infant in his cradle, Hadhrat Îsa spoke to the people and attested to his miraculous birth. This was just one of his many miracles that are mentioned in this Sûrah. Allâh assures people that Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm was neither killed nor crucified, but that he was lifted alive to the heavens.\n\nRasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam has informed us that Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm shall return to this world just before Qiyâmah to slay Dajjâl. He will then pass away naturally. However, the Christians adamantly believe that he was crucified.\n\nThe Christians were just as opposed to Islâm as the Jews were. Therefore, Allâh instructed Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam to issue a challenge of Mubâhala to them. The term Mubâhala is a challenge between two opposing factions where each gathers his family members and they collectively invoke Allâh's punishment on the opposite faction saying, \"O Allâh! Curse the party of us that is false and lying.\" However, the group of Christians whom Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam challenged shrank in fear from the challenge.\n\nThis part of Sûrah Âl Imrân discusses both the Battle of Badr as well as the Battle of Uhud. During the Battle of Badr the Muslims were only 313 in number and did not even have sufficient arms to fight with. On the other hand, the Mushrikîn were over a thousand and were armed to the teeth. However, Allâh sent thousands of angels to assist the Muslim army and they convincingly vanquished the enemy. This battle was the first battle that the Muslims fought."

		"description":"This summary, of the fourth Juz commences at the beginning of Sûrah Nisâ and concludes at the end of the fifth Juz (verse 147 of Sûrah Nisâ).",
		"content":"To avenge their defeat at Badr, the Mushrikîn of Makkah mustered large force to attack Madinah the following year. The two armies locked in combat near Mount Uhud.\n\nThe Muslims were on the brink of victory when a dispute between some Muslims resulted in their defeat. Instead of remaining at their posts as instructed, they left their posts to gather the booty. As a result of this, victory was turned into bitter defeat and Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam sustained a serious injury to his face. The Munâfiqîn [hypocrites] also plotted against the Muslims and made every effort to cause discord within the ranks of the Muslims. In this part of Sûrah Nisâ, Allâh points out the weaknesses of the Muslims and provides corrective measures to remedy them.\n\nAllâh also mentions the people who misinterpret the verses of the Qur'ân to meet their own ends. Such people are warned about a terrible punishment from Allâh. Allâh also forbids the Mu'minîn from taking the Kuffâr as their confidantes.\n\nAllâh emphatically prohibits false oaths and miserliness. Allâh also declares that a person's family and wealth are tests for him and should not be regarded as the criteria for salvation. Salvation can be attained only by developing Taqwa. The Mu'min sincerely believes in the Qur'ân, begs Allâh for his needs in all sincerity and does not seek payment from people for reciting the Qur'ân. The rewards for the pious Mu'minîn are secure with their Rabb in the Âkhirâh, where they will definitely receive it.\n\nAllâh exhorts the Mu'minîn to remain steadfast on the battlefield when confronted by the enemy and not to falter in their tracks. Allâh also praises the gentle temperament and excellent character of Rasulullâh towards the Muslims, a factor that contributed greatly towards the spread of Islâm.\n\nThe following guidance for social reformation is given:\n\n1.   Allâh strictly prohibits unlawful earnings and extorting money and property from others. For example, Allâh enjoins people to fully restore the wealth and property belonging to orphans. Allâh also cautions the guardians of orphans against substituting the good possessions of the orphans with their inferior ones.\n\n2.   Allâh makes it clear that a man is limited to only four wives at a time. Allâh also tells man that he should rather have only one wife if he fears that he would be unable to deal justly with them all. Due and amicable payment of dowry is emphasised in this Sûrah along with the specific shares of inheritance that heirs are to receive. Of course, Allâh clarifies that the settlement of debts is of paramount importance before dissolving any estate.\n\n3.   To purge society of the filth of adultery and fornication, Allâh has ordained that when four upright persons testify to witnessing any of these acts, those found guilty must be severely punished. Allâh also emphasises the importance of Taubah [repentance], which will be accepted only when it is sincerely done before a person's dying moments.\n\nEnd of Fourth Juz"

		"title":"Tharaweeh Summary - Night Five",
		"description":"This summary, of the fifth Tarawîh covers the entire sixth Juz.",
		"content":"One of the central themes of Sûrah Mâ'idah is that the laws of the Sharî'ah must be revered and upheld. In explaining this, the following injunctions have been highlighted:\n\n1. Hunting is prohibited after entering into the ihrâm.\n\n2. Halâl animals may be consumed only when they are slaughtered in Allâh's name. Carrion is Harâm, as is the flesh of: \n•pigs,\n•those animals that have been slaughtered in the name of any being besides Allâh,\n•those animals that have been throttled,\n•those that were beaten to death,\n•those that fell to their deaths,\n•those killed by collision, and\n•those that died after being attacked by wild beasts.\n\n3. Allâh tells man that he should never attempt to foretell the future by means of omens and other means of divining because such acts are the practice of sinners. All good and evil are in Allâh's control. Allâh tells the Muslims that they should have firm faith in their Dîn of Islâm which Allâh has perfected, thereby completing His enormous bounty on them. Therefore, Muslims should uphold the sanctity of Islâmic injunctions and critically distinguish between the lawful and the unlawful. Muslims are enjoined to abstain from evil and to be grateful.\n\nSûrah Mâ'idah contains laws that relate to man's religious, civil, social and political life. This Sûrah contains detailed guidance about:\n\nThe etiquette of the Hajj journey\n\nRevering the landmarks of Dîn\n\nThe perimeters of Halâl and Harâm\n\nMarriage and interaction with the Ahlul Kitâb [Jews and Christians]\n\nThe laws of Wudhu, Ghusl and Tayammum\n\nDealing with rebellion\n\nThe punishment for robbery and theft\n\nThe prohibition of liquor and gambling\n\nThe Kafâra [atonement] for breaking vows and\n\nThe detailed laws concerning testimony\n\nAllâh ordains that the hand of a male or female thief is to be cut off. The Muslims are also warned against taking the Jews and Christians as friends. Allâh makes it clear that the belief in the 'Trinity' constitutes kufr and that enmity and hatred for the Muslims have been entrenched into the hearts of the Kuffâr until Qiyâmah.\n\nAllâh entreats Rasulullâh Sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, not to be grieved about the disbelief of the Kuffâr because he is not responsible for them. Sûrah Mâ'idah also states that Jannah is forbidden for the Mushrikîn and that oppressors will have none to aid them against Allâh. Allâh says that those people of the past who adhered to the divine religions of their times will attain salvation if they firmly believed in Allâh and in the Day of Qiyâmah.\n\nEnd of the Sixth Juz"

		"title":"Tharaweeh Summary - Night Six",
		"description":"This summary of the sixth Tarawîh covers the Seventh Juz.",
		"content":"Beginning of the Seventh Juz\n\nAllâh also draws man's attention to the fact that the person who forbids something that Allâh has permitted will be guilty of following his carnal desires [his nafs] instead of Allâh's injunctions.\n\nAn example of this is the concept of monasticism that the Christians devised by which they would totally forsake the world and forbid themselves Halâl pleasures. This concept is incorrect and impermissible.\n\nAllâh also reminds the Mu'minîn that they will be taken to task for every oath that they fail to fulfil. The Kafâra [atonement] for breaching such a promise is that a person should either feed ten poor people, clothe them, set a slave free or fast for three days. Allâh also urges Muslims not to take intoxicants, not to gamble and not to divine the future. Allâh declares these acts to be Harâm (temptations) of Shaytân.\n\nSûrah Mâ'idah mentions how Allâh will question every Nabî about his nation. They will declare that they only did as they were told and that Allâh alone knows the reality of all hidden matters. The Sûrah also mentions the penalty for hunting an animal while in the state of Ihrâm. Of course, every such situation has its own unique set of circumstances, which will necessitate a unique ruling. These matters should be referred to the men of knowledge.\n\nOn the Day of Qiyâmah Allâh will remind Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm about his miraculous birth, about the various miracles that Allâh allowed him to perform and about the favours that Allâh bestowed on him and his mother Hadhrat Maryam (R.A). Allâh will then ask him, \"O Îsa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people, 'Take myself and my mother both as deities instead of Allâh?'\" Hadhrat Îsa will deny that he ever encouraged this and will accede, 'You know what is in my heart... I only told them what You had commanded me with i.e. 'Worship Allâh, Who is my Rabb and your Rabb!' ... If You punish them, then verily they are Your slaves, and if You pardon them, then surely You are the Mighty, the Wise.'\" (verses 116-118 of Sûrah Mâ'idah).\n\nSûrah An'âm commences after Sûrah Ma'idah. Allâh mentions that it has always been the practice of the Kuffâr to ridicule the Ambiyâ and to call them wizards. However, Allâh's Dîn will always conquer and rise, while the Kuffâr will suffer a terrible doom for their falsehood.\n\nWhereas Allâh provides sustenance to people and does not require any sustenance from them, other gods cannot provide sustenance for their devotees but rather require sustenance from them. Allâh exhorts Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam not to be distressed about the aversion of the Kuffâr, but to be patient because Allâh will definitely assist him. The Sûrâh makes it clear that none will be required to account for the actions of another on the Day of Qiyâmah and every person will be held responsible for his/her own acts. On the Day of Qiyâmah the Kuffâr will come to learn the errors of their ways. On that day, all kingdoms will belong solely to Allâh and none shall have any say in any matter.\n\nAfter describing how Hadhrat Ibrahîm recognised Allâh as his true Deity, Allâh tells the Quraysh of Makkah that his people denied him just as they (the Quraysh) deny the message of Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam. The conclusion is drawn from this that the Quraysh also stand to face the same destructive consequences as the people of Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm did.\n\nAllâh also points out that the worst oppressor is the one who lies about Allâh and who rebels against Allâh's commands. Oppressors will never be successful, especially in the Âkhirâh. Allâh has promised that the Day of Qiyâmah shall take place. Allâh advises the Women never to swear the gods of others so that they do not retort by swearing Allâh.\n\nEnd of Seventh Juz"

		"description":"This summary of the seventh Tarawîh covers the Eight Juz.",
		"content":"Beginning of Eighth Juz\n\nAllâh commands Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam to announce to the people, \"Certainly my Rabb has guided me to the straight path ... Surely my Salâh, all my acts of worship, my life and my death are for Allâh, the Rabb of the universe. He has no partner. With this have I been commanded and I am the first of those who surrender.\" (Sûrah An'âm, verses 161-163)\n\nThe following aspects have been emphasised in this Sûrah:\n\n1.   Never ascribe any partner to Allâh.\n2.   Treat parents kindly.\n3.   Never slay your children for fear of poverty because Allâh sustains everyone.\n4.   Never even come close to acts of promiscuity and immodesty.\n5.   Never take the life of any person without a legal right to do so.\n6.   Be just when weighing and measuring.\n7.   Always speak the truth and implement justice even though it may impact negatively on one's relatives.\n8.   Keep your word to Allâh and to fellow man.\n\nMuch of Sûrah A'râf concerns about the Âkhirah. In this regard Allâh instructs man to \"Follow what has been revealed to you from your Rabb and, leaving Him aside, do not follow other companions\" (verse 3). Allâh also says, \"We shall definitely question those to whom Ambiyâ were sent and We will surely question the Ambiyâ.\" (verse 6)\n\nPeople will be questioned about whether they followed the teachings of the Ambiyâ and the Ambiyâ will also be asked whether they fulfilled the task of propagation and about the attitude of their people. Every person will definitely have to pass the scales to have his/her acts weighed.\n\nAllâh draws man's attention to the fact that rejecting the truth like Qiyâmah and Risâlah [prophethood] is an act of Shaytân. To illustrate this point, Allâh mentions the disobedience of Shaytân when he refused to prostrate to Hadhrat Âdam when Allâh commanded him to do so. Allâh warns man not to act in a similar manner. Allâh also mentions that He granted man many favours when He settled him on earth and also granted him honour by commanding the angels to prostrate before his father Hadhrat Âdam Alayhis Salâm. However, despite all these boons, man is still ungrateful.\n\nLater in the Sûrah, Allâh cautions man not to transgress the limits that Allâh has set because \"Allâh does not like those who transgress.\" Allâh declares that He has forbidden all acts of immodesty, be they secret or public. He has also forbidden people from ascribing partners to Him and from ascribing false statements to Him. This is referred to in verse 33 where Allâh says, \"And that you say against Allâh what you do not know.\"\n\nIn verse 40 Allâh says, \"Indeed those who deny our verses and are arrogant towards them, the doors of the heavens will not be opened to them and they will not enter 3annah until a camel enters through the eye of a needle.\" It will therefore be impossible for them to enter Jannah. On the other hand, the righteous ones have been promised entry into Jannah. Therefore, the Mu'minîn should respond to Allâh's call with hope in His mercy and fear for His punishment because Allâh's mercy is definitely close to the righteous ones.\n\nThereafter Allâh relates the incidents of several Ambiyâ and states how the nations of these Ambiyâ refused to accept the truth, thereby inviting Allâh's punishment to annihilate them. These incidents are intended to be lessons for people so that they accept the message of Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam.\n\nEnd of the Eighth Juz"

		"content":"Beginning of the Ninth Juz\n\nAfter narrating these incidents Allâh says, \"When your Rabb extracted from the backs of the children of Âdam their progeny and called them to witness over themselves saying, 'Am I not your Rabb?' They replied, 'Certainly! We attest to it.'\" (verse 172)\n\nAllâh then says that those people who are greedy and live only to fulfil their desires are like dogs that pant with their tongues hanging out. Allâh has made Jahannam for these people because \"They have hearts with which they cannot understand, they have eyes with which they cannot see and they have ears with which they cannot hear. (In fact) They are like animals, but even more deviated.\" (verse 179)\n\nAllâh tells Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam it that if the Kuffâr call him a wizard or a madman, he should not heed their taunts and should tell them that he is a warner to them and a bearer of glad tidings to those who will accept his message. Allâh also explains to Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam that he should bear the harassment of the Kuffâr with tolerance so that any reaction of his should not obstruct the propagation of Islâm.\n\nIn verse 199 Allâh enjoins Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam saying, \"Adopt forgiveness, enjoin what is right and ignore the ignorant.\" In addition to this, Allâh also commands Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam to engage in dhikr morning and evening in the heart as well as verbally. We should pray to Allâh to grant us the ability to accept the Prophethood of Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam both verbally and practically. May He also grant us conviction in the Âkhirâh and make us among those who can sincerely ask from Him. Âmîn.\n\nAllâh opens Sûrah Anfâl by discussing the distribution of the spoils of war. Allâh says, \"The spoils of war are for Allâh and His messenger.\" (i.e. Rasulullâh would distribute one‑fifth of the booty among those who were deserving). Thereafter Allâh invokes man saying, \"So fear Allâh, correct your mutual relations and obey Allâh and His Nabî if you are believers.\" (verse 1).\n\nAllâh then described the true Mu'minîn when He says, \"The Mu'minîn are those whose hearts tremble when Allâh is mentioned, whose faith [Imân] increases when His verses are recited to them and they trust only in their Rabb. They are those who establish Salâh and spend from what We have provided for them. These are the true Mu'minîn! For them shall be ranks by their Rabb, forgiveness and bountiful sustenance.\" (verses 2-4)\n\nAllâh then mentions the assistance that He rendered to the Muslims during the Battle of Badr when He sent thousands of angels to fight with them. Allâh also cast fear into the hearts of the Kuffâr despite their overwhelming numbers. Allâh then declares that there awaits a severe punishment for those who oppose Allâh and Rasulullâh.\n\nThereafter, Allâh exhorts the Mu'minîn to fight in Jihâd with fervour. Allâh says, \"Oh you who believe, when you meet the disbelievers in battle, do not turn your backs to them\" (verse 15). Allâh says that the person who flees from the battlefield because of cowardice shall draw Allâh's wrath upon himself. Towards the end of the Juz, Allâh says, \"Fight them until no anarchy [kufr] exists and all religion (worship) is for Allâh. So if they desist (from kufr and shirk), then indeed Allâh is watchful over what they do. If they turn away, then know that Allâh is your Protecting Friend. What a terrific Friend and what a terrific Helper!' (verses 39 and 40).\n\nEnd of the Ninth Juz"

		"description":"This summary of the ninth Tarawîh covers the Tenth Juz.",
		"content":"Beginning of tenth Juz\n\nThe tenth Juz commences with mention of booty. Allâh declares, \"Know that from whatever spoils of war that you acquire, a fifth of it shall be for Allâh, His messenger, the relatives, the poor, the orphans and the travellers\" (verse 41).\n\nThe remaining four­-fifths will be distributed among the Mujâhidîn [the Muslim soldiers who fought in the battle].\n\nAllâh then discusses certain details about the Battle of Badr. Allâh addresses the Mu'minîn saying, \"Obey Allâh and His Nabî and do not fall into dispute with each other, for then you will become cowardly and your strength will be lost. Be patient, for verily Allâh is with the patient ones.\" (verse 46)\n\nAllâh commands the Muslims further: \"Prepare against them (your enemies) whatever forces of strength you can muster...\" (verse 60). In addition to amassing weapons and battle provisions, Muslims must always have conviction in Allâh's assistance. Allâh then assures the Muslims: \"Whatever you may spend in Allâh's way will be given to you in full and you will not be oppressed.\" (verse 60)\n\nAddressing Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam it, Allâh says, \"Oh Nabî Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam, exhort the Mu'minîn to fight.\" (verse 65). Allâh informs the Muslims that if they are righteous, resolute and trust firmly in Allâh, they will be able to vanquish an army larger than themselves.\n\nPrisoners of war should not be captured merely with the intention of earning ransom money. Towards the end of the Sûrah, Muslims are urged to keep religious objectives in mind when migrating or when waging Jihâd. Earning the booty must never be the objective. Allâh outlines a principle of inheritance at the end of Sûrah Anfâl when He says, ‑Those who are relatives are closer to each other in Allâh's Book. (verse 75)\n\nThe next Sûrah is called Sûrah Taubah because it contains mention of the Taubah that Allâh accepted from those who failed to participate in the Battle of Tabûk. It is also called Sûrah Barâ'ah because Allâh absolves Himself and Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam from what the Kuffâr do (the Arabic word \"Barâ'ah\" means \"to absolve of blame\").\n\nThis Sûrah mentions the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah which the Mushrikîn of Makkah eventually broke. Allâh declares, \"Allâh and His Nabî have absolved themselves of those Mushrikîn with whom you have made a treaty.\" Consequently, \"The proclamation from Allâh and His Nabî (was made) on the day of the greater Hajj that verily Allâh and His Nabî are absolved of the Mushrikîn.\" (verses 1 and 3)\n\nAfter this declaration, all Mushrikîn were banned from entering the Harâm and from performing Tawâf naked. The Muslims are urged not to take even their closest relatives as friends if they are Kuffâr. Allâh also advises Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam not to accept the lame excuses of the Munâfiqîn (hypocrites) when they are reluctant to fight in Jihâd. Their excuses are all false and the oaths that they take along with the excuses are all false. Allâh assures Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam that the oaths of the sinners and Munâfiqîn are hollow and should be ignored because these people were never Muslims. Allâh warns Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam that the Munâfiqîn will desert him as soon as they get the opportunity. Allâh's curse is on the Munâfiqîn men and women because they are alike. Allâh also forbade Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam from performing the janâzah [funeral] Salâh for the Munâfiqîn.\n\nThis Sûrah also details the recipients of zakâh as:\n1. The poor\n2. Slaves who are buying their freedom\n3. The destitute\n4. Those in debt\n5. The collectors of zakâh\n6. Those in \"Allâh's path\"\n7. Those who need to be inclined to Islâm and\n8. Travellers.\n\nIn brief, Sûrah Taubah contains the following subject matter:\n1. Certain battles and related incidents.\n2. The treaties with the Mushrikîn and the declaration of exoneration from all Kuffâr and Mushrikîn.\n3. Prohibition of fighting during the days of Hajj.\n4. Restriction of entry into the Haram for non‑Muslims.\n5. The command for the Ahlul Kitâb to either accept Islâm or pay the jizya.\n6. Reproaching those who were negligent in participating in Jihâd.\n7. Specifying the recipients of zakâh.\n8. Identifying the Munâfiqîn and the Mu'minîn.\n\nMay Allâh grant us all the Taufîq to practise on the injunctions detailed in this Sûrah. Âmîn.\n\nEnd of the Tenth Juz"

		"content":"Beginning of the Eleventh Juz.\n\nThe ending of the tenth Juz dealt with those Munâfiqîn who concocted excuses to evade conscription into the Muslim army. There were also many proud Munâfiqîn who saw no need to excuse themselves.\n\nThe opening verse of the Juz (verse 94 of Sûrah Taubah) refers to those Munâfiqîn who came to Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam after the Battle of Tabûk. Addressing Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam Allâh says, \"They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Tell them, 'Do not make excuses, we shall never believe you. Allâh has already informed us about your condition...'\" (verse 94)\n\nAllâh speaks about people who regard zakâh as a burden on their shoulders. Allâh says, \"Of the villagers are those who consider what they spend as a tax and they await the ill‑fortunes of fate to befall you. May the ill fortunes befall them! Allâh is All Hearing, All Knowing. (verse 98)\n\nAfter discussing the Munâfiqîn, Allâh speaks about the Mu'minîn in verse 100 when He says, \"The first to lead the way, from the Muhajirîn, the Ansâr, and those who followed them with sincerity; Allâh is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared for them such gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall abide forever. This is the ultimate success.\"\n\nThereafter, Allâh speaks about the Masjid of harm (Masjid Dirâr), the underlying purpose of which the Munâfiqîn built to promote hypocrisy and Mr among the Muslims. Allâh condemned its construction and the Muslims destroyed it. The subsequent verses make reference to the three Sahabah & who failed to participate in the expedition to Tabûk. They were boycotted for fifty days before Allâh announced the acceptance of their Taubah in this Sûrah.\n\nSûrah Yunus follows Sûrah Taubah. Sûrah Yunus also discusses the three fundamental issues of: Tauhîd [Oneness of Allâh], Risâlah [the Prophethood of Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam] Âkhirâh [the Hereafter].\n\nAttention is drawn to these beliefs by using occurrences and quoting momentous historical reports which serve to entrench these beliefs into the mind. Therefore, Allâh commences the Sûrah by stating, \"These are the verses of the wise Book. Are people surprised that We sent revelation to a man from among them?\" Those who respond to the message of Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam will be guided to salvation, whereas those who reject will be doomed to destruction and will not be saved by anyone's intercession. Allâh then proceeds to warn people of Jahannam and convey the glad tidings of Jannah to the Mu'minîn.\n\nIn verse 12 Allâh speaks about ungrateful people when He says, \"When any adversity afflicts man, he supplicates to Us lying down, sitting or standing. When We avert the adversity from him, he continues as if he has never supplicated to Us for the adversity that afflicted him.\"\n\nAllâh then relates the incidents of various Ambiyâ like Hadhrat Nûh, Hadhrat Mûsa and Hadhrat Yunus Alayhimus Salâm. In narrating these, Allâh impresses on man not to make the same  mistakes that the people of these Ambiyâ made.\n\nAt the end of the Sûrah Allâh declares, \"Say, O people! Certainly the truth has come to you from your Rabb. So whoever will be guided shall only receive guidance for himself (for his own benefit). Whoever will go astray shall only go astray to own detriment. I have not been commissioned over you. Follow what has been revealed to you and persevere until Allâh passes decision. He is the Best of the deciders.\" (verses 108-9)\n\nEnd of the Eleventh Juz"

		"content":"Beginning of the Twelfth Juz\n\nSûrah Hûd follows Sûrah Yunus and contains the incidents of many a past nation, describing the punishments that afflicted them because of their disbelief.\n\nThereafter the Sûrah illustrates the scene of Qiyâmah and the rewards and punishment to be received by various classes of people.\n\nAllâh introduces the Sûrah by saying, \"This is a Book, the verses of which have been consolidated and then expounded (coming from) The Wise, The Informed.\" Proceeding further, Allâh says, \"The responsibility for sustaining every creature on earth rests with Allâh.\" Allâh then describes how He created the universe. Allâh challenges man to produce Sûrahs the like of those in the Qur'ân if they feel that the Qur'ân is an invention of Rasulullâh it. However, even if they have to call everyone to their assistance, they will never be able to compose anything like the Qur'ân.\n\nMay Allâh grant us all the ability to appreciate all the bounties that He has granted us and may He include us among His grateful servants. May Allâh also grant us the Tawfîq to heed His every instruction and may He save us from arrogance and pride. Âmîn.\n\nAllâh states, \"And to the Âd We sent their brother Hûd (as a Nabî).\" Just as the people of Hadhrat Nûh remained stubborn the disbelief, the people of Hadhrat Hûd did the same. Instead of listening to the message of Tawhîd, the Âd exclaimed \"Who is more powerful than us?\" They were eventually destroyed. The nation of Thamud followed them. When they refused to accept the message of Hadhrat Sâlih Alayhis Salâm Allâh's punishment destroyed them as well. Mention is then made of the people of Hadhrat Lût who were extremely lewd and immoral. As a result of their depravity, they also suffered the same fate as their sister nations before them. Thereafter, Allâh mentions the preaching of Hadhrat Shu'ayb Alayhis Salâm to the people of Madyan, and then Allâh mentions the preaching of Hadhrat Mûsa Alayhis Salâm to Fir'aun and his people.\n\nAfter citing all these incidents Allâh says, \"Such is the grasp of your Rabb when He seized a town that is oppressive. Indeed His grasp is painful and severe.\" (verse 102)\n\nAddressing Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam Allâh says further, \"We narrate to you all the narratives of the Ambiyâ so that your heart may be strengthened by them. In these narratives the truth has come to you, as well as advice and a reminder for the Mu'minîn.\" (verse 120)\n\nAllâh then concludes Sûrah Hûd by saying, \"To Allâh belongs the unseen things of the heavens and the earth and unto Him alone will all matters return. So worship Him and rely on Him only. Your Rabb is not unaware of what you do.\" (verse 123)\n\nSûrah Yusuf follows Sûrah Hûd. Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam was not aware of the story of Hadhrat Yusuf so the Jews decided to test his prophethood by, asking him about this story. They thought that he would be unable to narrate the story to them. However, Allâh revealed Sûrah Yusuf to Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam thereby stunning the Jews with its detailed account.\n\nAs a youth, Hadhrat Yusuf once saw in a dream that eleven stars, the sun and the moon were prostrating before him. The eleven stars denoted his eleven step‑brother, while the sun and moon denoted his parents. When he informed his father Hadhrat Yaqûb, about the dream, his father advised him not to relate the dream to his brothers because they would be jealous and then become his sworn enemies.\n\nHis brothers had always been jealous of Hadhrat Yusuf and finally threw him in a well one day, making the excuse to their father that a wolf had devoured him. Some travellers took him out of the well and sold him as a slave to the chief minister of Egypt. The minister's wife was infatuated with Hadhrat Yusuf's beauty and attempted to seduce him. When he refused to respond to her charms, she had him imprisoned. While in prison he accurately interpreted the dreams of two fellow inmates. When one of them was released, he (after some time) referred the king's dream to Hadhrat Yusuf who interpreted it correctly and even provided a solution for the problem at hand. As a result, Hadhrat Yusuf became a trusted advisor to the king and practically ruled Egypt.\n\nEnd of the Twelfth Juz"
