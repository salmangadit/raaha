		"description":"This summary covers the first one and a quarter Juzu of the Qur'ân, beginning with Sûrah Fâtiha and concluding with verse 176 of Sûrah Baqara.",
		"content":"Start of First Juz \n\nSûrah Fâtiha is usually referred to as Al Hamd Sharîf. Although this Sûrah was not the first Sûrah of the Qur'ân to be revealed, it is the first to be written in Qur'ânic manuscripts and the first to be recited when commencing recitation (Tilâwah) of the Qur'ân.\n\nSûrah Fâtiha is a du'â [supplication] that Allâh has taught mankind. Therefore, when a person recites Sûrah Fâtiha, s/he is actually making a du'â to Allâh. The rest of the Qur'ân follows as a reply to this du'â. In this du'â a person pleads to Allâh to show him the straight path [Sirâtul Mustaqîm]. Thereafter, Allâh gives man the entire Qur'ân as the guidance he asked for and as a description of the Sirâtul Mustaqîm which he wants to tread.\n\nSûrah Baqara follows Sûrah Fâtiha, in which Allâh says that the Qur'ân is a guide for people who have Taqwa. Therefore, the Qur'ân may not benefit those who have no desire for guidance and direction. Such people will be deprived of its illumination and shall remain spiritually deaf, dumb and blind. In Sûrah Baqara, Allâh invokes man to believe in the unseen, to establish Salâh and to spend in Allâh's way from the provisions that He has granted. The details of Imân are described as belief in the Qur'ân, belief in all the previously revealed Divine Scriptures and conviction in the Âkhirâh.\n\nAllâh also warns people against hypocrisy, warns the Kuffâr about the punishment of Jahannam, while also conveying the glad tidings of Jannah to the Mu'minîn. It is in this part of Sûrah Baqara that Allâh speaks about the creation of Hadhrat Âdam Alayhis Salâm and his appointment as Allâh's viceroy on earth. The test between the knowledge of Hadhrat Âdam and the angels is mentioned, together with Allâh's command to the angels to prostrate before Hadhrat Âdam. While all the angels complied, Iblîs refused. As a result of his arrogance, he was cursed and expelled from Jannah. Thereafter, the accursed Iblîs, tricked Hadhrat Adam Alayhis Salâm and Hadhrat Hawa Radiallâhu anha into eating from the forbidden tree. Thereafter, they were sent to live on earth. They repented to Allâh and were forgiven.\n\nAllâh also speaks of the time when He summoned Hadhrat Mûsa Alayhis Salâm toMount Tûr to receive the Torah [Taurat]. In his absence, the Bani Isrâ'îl began to worship the calf. However, they were forgiven for this act when they repented. On a daily basis Allâh provided them with Mann and Salwa to eat from the heavens, and also provided water for them from twelve springs that gushed from a rock. Allâh describes how the Jews were ungrateful for Allâh's bounties and how they behaved rebelliously and insolently. This, together with their hypocritical conduct drew Allâh's punishment upon them.\n\nThereafter, Allâh speaks about Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm who was successful in every trial that Allâh put him through. As a reward for this, Allâh made him a guide of mankind. Allâh commanded him and his son Hadhrat Ismâ'îl Alayhis Salâm to construct the Ka'bah, which they duly did. Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm made du'â to Allâh to raise a Nabî from among his progeny who would be a guide for mankind. Allâh accepted this du'â by raising Hadhrat Muhammad Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam, as a Nabî to the universe, via whom guidance spread throughout the world.\n\nEnd of First Juz\n\nBeginning of Second Juz\n\nThe beginning of the second Juz discusses the change of Qiblah. Allâh commands the Muslims to face towards the Ka'bah instead of Baitul Muqaddas [Jerusalem] when performing Salâh. Consequently, Muslims will always be required to face towards the Ka'bah wherever they may be. Allâh also prohibits the eating of carrion (dead animals), blood, swine and all animals that have been sacrificed in the name of any being besides Allâh"

		"description":"This summary of the second Tarawîh begins at the second quarter of the second Juz and concludes midway into the third Juz (at verse 18 of Sûrah Âl Imrân).",
		"content":"To a very large extent, Sûrah Baqara discusses the complete message of Islâm, dealing with matters such as the rights of Allâh, the rights of man, the method of living and the principles of social interaction. It also outlines laws pertaining to Salâh, Zakâh and Haj.\n\nIn addition to this, charity, social welfare, mutual consultation, marriage, divorce, Iddah [waiting period after a woman is divorced or widowed], bequests, commerce and giving loans are also discussed. The Sûrah also presents many commands and prohibitions, devoting much attention to matters that are permissible and those that are not. These may be referred to as a complete code of life.\n\nThe details of Imân and the criteria of Imân are also discussed in this part of the Sûrah. Allâh emphasises that people should believe in Allâh, His Rasul it, the Day of Qiyâmah, the angels, all His other Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm and all the Divine Scriptures that were revealed to various Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm during their respective periods. Allâh also commands Muslims to spend generously on their parents, relatives, the poor, orphans, travellers and those slaves who wish to purchase their freedom.\n\nAllâh commands that a murderer be executed [Qisâs]. However, if the heirs of the murdered person choose to rather accept the blood money, it will have to be paid. Fasting is ordained in this Sûrah, but people who are unable to fast have been granted certain concessions. Allâh makes it clear that marriage of Muslims to Mushrikîn men and women is prohibited. In addition to this, the Sûrah makes it clear that children are allowed to be suckled for a maximum period of two years.\n\nEnd of Second Juz\n\nBeginning of Third Juz\n\nAllâh declares all interest-related transactions to be undeniably Harâm towards the end of Sûrah Baqara. The Sûrah also relates the incidents of two Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm whose hearts Allâh put at ease when He demonstrated to them how He resurrects the dead. Throughout Sûrah Baqara, Allâh repeatedly emphasises the importance of pondering over the verses of the Qur'ân. At the very end of the Sûrah, Allâh teaches man the method of making du'â as well as the words to be used.\n\nThe first eighteen verses of Sûrah Âl Imrân make it clear that only Allâh is worthy of worship, that the Day of Qiyâmah will certainly dawn and that the people will definitely be rewarded and punished for their actions. Allâh tells mankind that the Qur'ân was revealed to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Allâh also speaks of the Battle of Badr in this Sûrah. If the Mu'minîn were to ponder about the stunning victory that the Muslims earned in this battle, they can learn volumes about Allâh's power. The true Mu'minîn are defined as people who persevere through hardships, who spend their wealth in Allâh's way and awaken during the latter part of the night to beg pardon from Allâh."

		"content":"Allâh speaks of Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm and his mother Hadhrat Maryam Radiallâhu anha. When she was placed in the care of Hadhrat Zakariyya Alayhis Salâm he noticed that she used to eat fruits that were not in season.\n\nUpon enquiry, she told him that it was from Allâh who sustains whomsoever He wills without any restrictions. This Sûrah mentions the miraculous birth of Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm from Hadhrat Maryam Radiallâhu anha without a father. As an infant in his cradle, Hadhrat Îsa spoke to the people and attested to his miraculous birth. This was just one of his many miracles that are mentioned in this Sûrah. Allâh assures people that Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm was neither killed nor crucified, but that he was lifted alive to the heavens.\n\nRasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam has informed us that Hadhrat Îsa Alayhis Salâm shall return to this world just before Qiyâmah to slay Dajjâl. He will then pass away naturally. However, the Christians adamantly believe that he was crucified.\n\nThe Christians were just as opposed to Islâm as the Jews were. Therefore, Allâh instructed Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam to issue a challenge of Mubâhala to them. The term Mubâhala is a challenge between two opposing factions where each gathers his family members and they collectively invoke Allâh's punishment on the opposite faction saying, "O Allâh! Curse the party of us that is false and lying." However, the group of Christians whom Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam challenged shrank in fear from the challenge.\n\nThis part of Sûrah Âl Imrân discusses both the Battle of Badr as well as the Battle of Uhud. During the Battle of Badr the Muslims were only 313 in number and did not even have sufficient arms to fight with. On the other hand, the Mushrikîn were over a thousand and were armed to the teeth. However, Allâh sent thousands of angels to assist the Muslim army and they convincingly vanquished the enemy. This battle was the first battle that the Muslims fought."

		"description":"This summary, of the fourth Juz commences at the beginning of Sûrah Nisâ and concludes at the end of the fifth Juz (verse 147 of Sûrah Nisâ).",
		"content":"To avenge their defeat at Badr, the Mushrikîn of Makkah mustered large force to attack Madinah the following year. The two armies locked in combat near Mount Uhud.\n\nThe Muslims were on the brink of victory when a dispute between some Muslims resulted in their defeat. Instead of remaining at their posts as instructed, they left their posts to gather the booty. As a result of this, victory was turned into bitter defeat and Rasulullâh Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam sustained a serious injury to his face. The Munâfiqîn [hypocrites] also plotted against the Muslims and made every effort to cause discord within the ranks of the Muslims. In this part of Sûrah Nisâ, Allâh points out the weaknesses of the Muslims and provides corrective measures to remedy them.\n\nAllâh also mentions the people who misinterpret the verses of the Qur'ân to meet their own ends. Such people are warned about a terrible punishment from Allâh. Allâh also forbids the Mu'minîn from taking the Kuffâr as their confidantes.\n\nAllâh emphatically prohibits false oaths and miserliness. Allâh also declares that a person's family and wealth are tests for him and should not be regarded as the criteria for salvation. Salvation can be attained only by developing Taqwa. The Mu'min sincerely believes in the Qur'ân, begs Allâh for his needs in all sincerity and does not seek payment from people for reciting the Qur'ân. The rewards for the pious Mu'minîn are secure with their Rabb in the Âkhirâh, where they will definitely receive it.\n\nAllâh exhorts the Mu'minîn to remain steadfast on the battlefield when confronted by the enemy and not to falter in their tracks. Allâh also praises the gentle temperament and excellent character of Rasulullâh towards the Muslims, a factor that contributed greatly towards the spread of Islâm.\n\nThe following guidance for social reformation is given:\n\n1.   Allâh strictly prohibits unlawful earnings and extorting money and property from others. For example, Allâh enjoins people to fully restore the wealth and property belonging to orphans. Allâh also cautions the guardians of orphans against substituting the good possessions of the orphans with their inferior ones.\n\n2.   Allâh makes it clear that a man is limited to only four wives at a time. Allâh also tells man that he should rather have only one wife if he fears that he would be unable to deal justly with them all. Due and amicable payment of dowry is emphasised in this Sûrah along with the specific shares of inheritance that heirs are to receive. Of course, Allâh clarifies that the settlement of debts is of paramount importance before dissolving any estate.\n\n3.   To purge society of the filth of adultery and fornication, Allâh has ordained that when four upright persons testify to witnessing any of these acts, those found guilty must be severely punished. Allâh also emphasises the importance of Taubah [repentance], which will be accepted only when it is sincerely done before a person's dying moments.\n\nEnd of Fourth Juz"

		"content":"One of the central themes of Sûrah Mâ'idah is that the laws of the Sharî'ah must be revered and upheld. In explaining this, the following injunctions have been highlighted:\n\n1. Hunting is prohibited after entering into the ihrâm.\n\n2. Halâl animals may be consumed only when they are slaughtered in Allâh's name. Carrion is Harâm, as is the flesh of: \n•pigs,\n•those animals that have been slaughtered in the name of any being besides Allâh,\n•those animals that have been throttled,\n•those that were beaten to death,\n•those that fell to their deaths,\n•those killed by collision, and\n•those that died after being attacked by wild beasts.\n\n3. Allâh tells man that he should never attempt to foretell the future by means of omens and other means of divining because such acts are the practice of sinners. All good and evil are in Allâh's control. Allâh tells the Muslims that they should have firm faith in their Dîn of Islâm which Allâh has perfected, thereby completing His enormous bounty on them. Therefore, Muslims should uphold the sanctity of Islâmic injunctions and critically distinguish between the lawful and the unlawful. Muslims are enjoined to abstain from evil and to be grateful.\n\nSûrah Mâ'idah contains laws that relate to man's religious, civil, social and political life. This Sûrah contains detailed guidance about:\n\nThe etiquette of the Hajj journey\n\nRevering the landmarks of Dîn\n\nThe perimeters of Halâl and Harâm\n\nMarriage and interaction with the Ahlul Kitâb [Jews and Christians]\n\nThe laws of Wudhu, Ghusl and Tayammum\n\nDealing with rebellion\n\nThe punishment for robbery and theft\n\nThe prohibition of liquor and gambling\n\nThe Kafâra [atonement] for breaking vows and\n\nThe detailed laws concerning testimony\n\nAllâh ordains that the hand of a male or female thief is to be cut off. The Muslims are also warned against taking the Jews and Christians as friends. Allâh makes it clear that the belief in the 'Trinity' constitutes kufr and that enmity and hatred for the Muslims have been entrenched into the hearts of the Kuffâr until Qiyâmah.\n\nAllâh entreats Rasulullâh Sallallahu 'alayhi wasallam, not to be grieved about the disbelief of the Kuffâr because he is not responsible for them. Sûrah Mâ'idah also states that Jannah is forbidden for the Mushrikîn and that oppressors will have none to aid them against Allâh. Allâh says that those people of the past who adhered to the divine religions of their times will attain salvation if they firmly believed in Allâh and in the Day of Qiyâmah.\n\nEnd of the Sixth Juz"

Allâh emphasises that people should believe in Allâh, His Rasul it, the Day of Qiyâmah, the angels, all His other Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm and all the Divine Scriptures that were revealed to various Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm during their respective periods. Allâh also commands Muslims to spend generously on their parents, relatives, the poor, orphans, travellers and those slaves who wish to purchase their freedom.\n\nAllâh commands that a murderer be executed [Qisâs]. However, if the heirs of the murdered person choose to rather accept the blood money, it will have to be paid. Fasting is ordained in this Sûrah, but people who are unable to fast have been granted certain concessions. Allâh makes it clear that marriage of Muslims to Mushrikîn men and women is prohibited. In addition to this, the Sûrah makes it clear that children are allowed to be suckled for a maximum period of two years.\n\nEnd of Second Juz\n\nBeginning of Third Juz\n\nAllâh declares all interest-related transactions to be undeniably Harâm towards the end of Sûrah Baqara. The Sûrah also relates the incidents of two Ambiyâ Alayhimus Salâm whose hearts Allâh put at ease when He demonstrated to them how He resurrects the dead. Throughout Sûrah Baqara, Allâh repeatedly emphasises the importance of pondering over the verses of the Qur'ân. At the very end of the Sûrah, Allâh teaches man the method of making du'â as well as the words to be used.\n\nThe first eighteen verses of Sûrah Âl Imrân make it clear that only Allâh is worthy of worship, that the Day of Qiyâmah will certainly dawn and that the people will definitely be rewarded and punished for their actions. Allâh tells mankind that the Qur'ân was revealed to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Allâh also speaks of the Battle of Badr in this Sûrah. If the Mu'minîn were to ponder about the stunning victory that the Muslims earned in this battle, they can learn volumes about Allâh's power. The true Mu'minîn are defined as people who persevere through hardships, who spend their wealth in Allâh's way and awaken during the latter part of the night to beg pardon from Allâh."
