	"content":"This summary covers the first one and a quarter Juzu of the Qur'ân, beginning with Sûrah Fâtiha and concluding with verse 176 of Sûrah Baqara.
Start of First Juz
Sûrah Fâtiha is usually referred to as Al Hamd Sharîf. Although this Sûrah was not the first Sûrah of the Qur'ân to be revealed, it is the first to be written in Qur'ânic manuscripts and the first to be recited when commencing recitation (Tilâwah) of the Qur'ân.
Sûrah Fâtiha is a du'â [supplication] that Allâh has taught mankind. Therefore, when a person recites Sûrah Fâtiha, s/he is actually making a du'â to Allâh. The rest of the Qur'ân follows as a reply to this du'â. In this du'â a person pleads to Allâh to show him the straight path [Sirâtul Mustaqîm]. Thereafter, Allâh gives man the entire Qur'ân as the guidance he asked for and as a description of the Sirâtul Mustaqîm which he wants to tread.
Sûrah Baqara follows Sûrah Fâtiha, in which Allâh says that the Qur'ân is a guide for people who have Taqwa. Therefore, the Qur'ân may not benefit those who have no desire for guidance and direction. Such people will be deprived of its illumination and shall remain spiritually deaf, dumb and blind. In Sûrah Baqara, Allâh invokes man to believe in the unseen, to establish Salâh and to spend in Allâh's way from the provisions that He has granted. The details of Imân are described as belief in the Qur'ân, belief in all the previously revealed Divine Scriptures and conviction in the Âkhirâh.

Allâh also warns people against hypocrisy, warns the Kuffâr about the punishment of Jahannam, while also conveying the glad tidings of Jannah to the Mu'minîn. It is in this part of Sûrah Baqara that Allâh speaks about the creation of Hadhrat Âdam Alayhis Salâm and his appointment as Allâh's viceroy on earth. The test between the knowledge of Hadhrat Âdam and the angels is mentioned, together with Allâh's command to the angels to prostrate before Hadhrat Âdam. While all the angels complied, Iblîs refused. As a result of his arrogance, he was cursed and expelled from Jannah. Thereafter, the accursed Iblîs, tricked Hadhrat Adam Alayhis Salâm and Hadhrat Hawa Radiallâhu anha into eating from the forbidden tree. Thereafter, they were sent to live on earth. They repented to Allâh and were forgiven.

Allâh also speaks of the time when He summoned Hadhrat Mûsa Alayhis Salâm toMount Tûr to receive the Torah [Taurat]. In his absence, the Bani Isrâ'îl began to worship the calf. However, they were forgiven for this act when they repented. On a daily basis Allâh provided them with Mann and Salwa to eat from the heavens, and also provided water for them from twelve springs that gushed from a rock. Allâh describes how the Jews were ungrateful for Allâh's bounties and how they behaved rebelliously and insolently. This, together with their hypocritical conduct drew Allâh's punishment upon them.

Thereafter, Allâh speaks about Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm who was successful in every trial that Allâh put him through. As a reward for this, Allâh made him a guide of mankind. Allâh commanded him and his son Hadhrat Ismâ'îl Alayhis Salâm to construct the Ka'bah, which they duly did. Hadhrat Ibrahîm Alayhis Salâm made du'â to Allâh to raise a Nabî from among his progeny who would be a guide for mankind. Allâh accepted this du'â by raising Hadhrat Muhammad Sallallâhu 'alayhi wasallam, as a Nabî to the universe, via whom guidance spread throughout the world.

End of First Juz

Beginning of Second Juz

The beginning of the second Juz discusses the change of Qiblah. Allâh commands the Muslims to face towards the Ka'bah instead of Baitul Muqaddas [Jerusalem] when performing Salâh. Consequently, Muslims will always be required to face towards the Ka'bah wherever they may be. Allâh also prohibits the eating of carrion (dead animals), blood, swine and all animals that have been sacrificed in the name of any being besides Allâh"
